# Description

<!-- A short description of the task; one sentence or a few. Keep it short. -->

---

# Goal

<!-- A clear criterium for the task to be considered done. -->

---

# Owner

<!-- Your name. WIP and completed tasks must have an owner. The owner is
     responsible for delivering the task's result and move it into the
     "done" state after its completion. -->

NAMING CONVENTION FOR TASK NOTES
--------------------------------

Task notes should be named and renamed following this pattern:

    <status>.<task>.<priority>.md

<status> is one of those options:
    open    : no owners, no progress made yet
    wip     : Work In Progress; has a dedicated task owner, report is expected
    done    : finished/ accomplished task
    topic   : not an actionable itself, but an area or topic that produces
              actionable tasks; however, should have a concrete goal just as well
              (primarily for brainstorming or outlining)

<task> should contain the key expression for the task, to grasp
at a glance what's in the note while the file content describes
the details. Use dash (-) or underscore (_) instead of whitespace ( ).

<priority> is a number between 1 and 5 with the meaning as follows:

    1 - TOP         : requires immediate action
    2 - IMPORTANT   : should be processed ASAP (e.g. other tasks depend on it)
    3 - NORMAL      : important to reach milestone, but can be delayed
    4 - LOW         : contributes to milestone, but probably has lesser impact
    5 - OPTIONAL    : optional feature or idea to improve overall performance/
                      output, but can be dropped entirely without consequences

Examples:
    done.firewall-eda.3.md
    open.phishing-cnn.3.md
    topic.presentation.2.md
    topic.presentation-style.2.md
    wip.phishing-random-forest.3.md
